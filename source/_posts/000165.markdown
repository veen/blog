<em>Sales Guy:</em> That will be one hundred and twenty five dollars.
<em>Jeff:</em> One twenty five even?
<em>SG:</em> Yes.
<em>J:</em> Oh, right, no sales tax here.
<em>SG:</em> Nope. You pay what's on the tag.
<em>J:</em> Neat.
<em>SG:</em> Uh huh.
<em>J:</em> So how do you build roads and stuff?
<em>SG:</em> With asphalt and steamrollers.
<em>J:</em> ...
<em>SG:</em> ...
<em>J:</em> Higher income tax, then?
<em>SG:</em> Yeah. And the lottery. We make a lot off the lottery.
<em>J:</em> So you tax people who are bad at math?
<em>SG:</em> Exactly. Enjoy your shoes.
<em>J:</em> Bye.
